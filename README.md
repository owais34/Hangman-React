## Description

HangMan word guessing game made using React.JS with built in hooks .
The web app was implemented from scratch with custom UI built using vanilla CSS3 and no UI libraries.
Responsive UI realised using the all powerful flexbox .

## How to play

- Guess the word by filling the blank spaces 
- Click on the letters which you think might be present in the word
- A correct guess fills up the corresponding places in the word automatically.
- A wrong guess fills the hangman stick figure by one step 
- Make the right guesses and complete the blanks before the stick figure completes.

### Components used in build

The whole ui and theme is plain CSS .
